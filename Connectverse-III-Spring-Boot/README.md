## Problem and its relevance to today's market / society
   India faces a critical problem illiteracy + employment = mass rural Un-Employment. So when it comes to rural development there are 9 million unorganized workers they are un-educated so they cant use website or any mobile apps exists to find or apply jobs so our solution handles this problem and paves an way for unorganized workers can also apply for the job.

## Solution Developed
   Connectverse is a platform where people are educated about jobs in their area and jobs are assigned to people based on their location and also we have developed our own utility for to help un-organized workers to find job. Many people become stuck when they begin working on projects; They can also collaborate with industry level people to improve their quality; We also provide courses to the people to help them gain skills required for the industry.

## Uniqueness fo Connecteverse
   First and foremost, workers can be separated based on the work they prefer to do, which will give them an advantage in working more efficiently. Workers will be assigned jobs based on their geographical location, andÂ if workers were ready to migrate and work ,it would also be appreciated and assigned. Everone will be able to use this website , we using some symbols for showing the various Steps of the job process so that even an illiterate will be able to identify the status of the job. 

## How Connectverse is different from Different platforms
   This is the first project that address the problem of job of the unorganized workers. with the challenge that they don't know to read and
write. not just to find job is problem here to make it reaching rural areas and make them understand is the challenge here.

## Useers Base
   As per our calculation if this utility is reduced atleast of of 9 million unorganized workers minimum of 5 million workers will benifitted.
and this utility is so generic as this can be applied in any fields for both organized and un-organized workers.

## Scalability
   This project is developed in microservices architecture. so it is easy to scaleable that many users can use this at a time Max requests per second = 400.

## Business Model
   The company needs workers for each worker they hire through out utility they have to pay duty to us and also every company spends 3 - 4 percentage of their revenue for marketing so that way the revenue to the company can be raised so as the users increase the utility will be economically stable.

## Friendsly
   This so friendly that even the persons who is uneducated  can use our project to get jobs. We have developed and integrated an technology that helps eu-educated people can also find and apply for the jobs based in their requirements, location they live, amount they want as salary etc...

# Concept:
  - You Can learn technical skills and apply for job here in this site.
  - and for non-technicl workers the data will be comming directly comming from E-Sharm a national database for unorganized workers.
  - after 100 days worker scheme the data will be collected from esharm and posted in connectverse so that employers can hire them for their work.
